- 👋 Hi, I’m @kraemaj0
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things and have been poking my noses in a variety of fields like business development, operations, ecommerce, marketing, sales, accounting, programming etc. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything that I can learn from various fields as mentioned above
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate projects that interest me. I am looking forward to develop a game of my own, however small it may be, with my current programming skills which are very limited.
